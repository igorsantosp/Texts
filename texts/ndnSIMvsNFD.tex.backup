\section{Introduction}
\label{S:1}
NDN is a very promissing architecture that is being developed in the last few years, it aspires to be the sucessor of the actual most used architecture, the IP architecture, despites being a good solution for many problems that the IP architecture has facing, NDN is still being developed, for that, the academia and the developers need tools to test, study and improve the NDN algorithms, tools preferably, powerful, opensource and less complex as possible for the users so the tools can be common, have the wide research commumity and helps the community to develop faster the ideals algorithms for this new architecture \par
ndnSIM and NFD are so far the most relevant and used tools in the research and development of NDN networks, each one have its own applications, even usually used together for a realystic simulation, they are in fact separate things, having each one a different function.
\section{Main Conceipts}

\subsection{ndnSIM}
ndnSIM is a network simulator based on the ns-3 simulator, one of the most porwerful tools in simulating networks. ndnSIM can be described as a framework built over ns-3 to simulate NDN network, ndnSIM have its applications written in c++ and even though its a application built to simulate NDN networks it uses NFD as its core to implement NDN functions such as PIT's, FIB's and Content Store functions. \par
